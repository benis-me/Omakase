# Omakase (`omks`)

> Orchestrate the AI agent CLIs you already have installed — with **Dynamic Workflows** and a **Goal‑loop** that keeps working until the job is verifiably done.

Omakase is a local‑first, open‑source CLI + TUI that turns `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor-agent` (and more) into a fleet you can compose. You give it a **goal**; it plans, dispatches agents in parallel, verifies the result against success criteria, and loops until it's met — with durable **resume**, **retry**, and an event‑sourced history of everything that happened.

Built on **Bun**, **TypeScript**, **React 19** and **OpenTUI**. Zero runtime dependencies outside the terminal and browser renderers.

```

## Why

Every agent CLI is a silo. Omakase is the layer above them:

- **Use what you have.** It auto‑detects installed agent CLIs and drives them headlessly. No API keys to re‑enter, no lock‑in.
- **Dynamic Workflows.** Orchestration is code — small Bun/TypeScript files with a tiny `w` API (`phase`, `agent`, `parallel`, `pipeline`, `loopUntil`). They're **reusable, versioned, and used like Skills**: the more you write, the more capable Omakase gets.
- **Goal‑loop.** Define success criteria (a command that must exit 0, a file that must exist, or a natural‑language rubric judged by an agent). Omakase loops — plan → build → **verify** → fix — until they pass or a budget stops it. The verifier keeps autonomous runs honest instead of self‑declaring victory.
- **Durable.** Every run is an append‑only event log in SQLite. Interrupted? `omks resume <id>` replays completed work from cache and continues. Flaky provider? Foundation retry with backoff.
- **One seam for agent runtimes.** The engine talks to a `Harness` interface rather than to CLIs directly. Two implementations ship today — subprocess (the real one) and mock (for `workflow test`); an ACP or in‑process harness would slot in behind the same seam, but that is a design affordance, not something built yet.

## Install

Requires **[Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3** and at least one agent CLI on your `PATH`
(`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, or `cursor-agent`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benis-me/Omakase
cd Omakase
bun install
bun link            # exposes `omks` globally (or: alias omks="bun /path/to/packages/cli/bin/omks.ts")
```

## Quickstart

```bash
cd my-project
omks init                       # create the .omks workspace
omks doctor                     # check providers + workflows

# Run a goal (headless), streaming progress:
omks run "add a /healthz endpoint and a test" --check "bun test"

# …or just launch the TUI:
omks
```

`omks "build me X"` is shorthand for `omks run "build me X"`.

---

## Real run

This is a **real, unedited run** — not a mock. In an empty directory:

```bash
omks run "Implement a TypeScript token-bucket rate limiter as a Bun project:
  package.json, src/rate-limiter.ts (a RateLimiter class with capacity +
  refillPerSecond, tryRemove(n=1), time-based refill, injectable clock), and
  src/rate-limiter.test.ts (bun:test) covering burst, denial, and refill.
  Make sure 'bun test' passes." \
  --workflow goal --provider claude --check "bun test" --max-agents 12
```

What Omakase did:

1. **Planned 4 steps** (package.json → limiter → tests → run the suite).
2. Built + peer‑reviewed each step in a pipeline.
3. **The Goal‑loop ran the real `bun test`** as its success criterion and looped
   until it went green — no self‑declared victory.
4. `✓ succeeded` — **9 agent turns, ~$2.46**.

The result is a working library (`bun test` → **4 pass, 0 fail, 18 assertions**),
including a proper injectable clock so the time‑based tests are deterministic:

```ts
// src/rate-limiter.ts  (generated)
export class RateLimiter {
  constructor({ capacity, refillPerSecond, now = Date.now }: RateLimiterOptions) { … }
  tryRemove(n = 1): boolean { this.refill(); if (this.tokens >= n) { this.tokens -= n; return true; } return false; }
  available(): number { this.refill(); return this.tokens; }
}
```

The point isn't that an agent wrote code — it's that Omakase **planned it, ran it
in parallel, and refused to finish until `bun test` actually passed.**

  runs [show <id>]              list / inspect past runs
  logs <runId> [-f]             print / follow a run’s event stream

AGENTS & CONFIG
  agent list                    show installed agent CLIs
  agent scan                    re-detect providers + models
  agent check                   verify each provider is authenticated

  session [list|show]           grouped runs
  doctor                        environment diagnostics
  web [--port n] [--open]       browser control center (default :4517)
  mcp                           run as an MCP server (stdio) for other agents

RUN OPTIONS
  --workflow, -w <name>         pick a workflow (default: goal)
  --provider, -p <id>           pin claude|codex|gemini|cursor-agent
  --model, -m <model>           pin a model
  --check "<cmd>"               success check: command must exit 0 (repeatable)
  --criteria "<text>"           natural-language criterion, judged (repeatable)
  --max-agents <n>              cap agent calls   --concurrency <n>  parallelism
  --max-usd <n>                 cap total spend   --max-time <sec>   wall-clock budget
  --max-rounds <n>              cap goal-loop rounds (plan → build → verify → fix)
  --param k=v                   workflow parameter (repeatable)
  --session, -s <id>            continue a session   --cwd <dir>  working directory
  --permission <mode>           read-only | edit | bypass (default: workspace setting)

  --json                        emit one JSON event per line (JSONL)
```

Every cap must be a positive number — `--max-agents 0` is rejected rather than
silently ignored. A repeatable flag with no value (`--check` followed by another
flag) is a usage error too, so a missing check can't quietly become one that
always passes.

## The terminal UI

`omks` with no arguments opens the TUI: a runs sidebar on the left, the live
event log on the right, and a composer at the bottom. It reads the same store
as the CLI, so a run you started headlessly shows up here and vice‑versa.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `⏎` | run the goal (or the typed command) |
| `⌥⏎` | newline in the composer — a goal can be several lines |
| `/` | open the command palette |
| `↑ ↓` | browse runs (or pick a command when the palette is open) |
| `⇥` | cycle the workflow (or complete a command) |
| `⇞ ⇟` | scroll the log back and forward — the title shows `↑N` while held |
| `^F` | full text: wrap agent results instead of clipping them |
| `^U` · `^R` | clear the composer · refresh the runs list |
| `esc` · `^C` | cancel a run · clear the input · quit |

Slash commands: `/workflow <name>`, `/provider <id\|auto>`, `/settings`,
`/runs`, `/resume <runId>`, `/cancel`, `/clear`, `/help`, `/quit`.

## Headless & scripting

Everything the TUI does is available without it, which is the point — Omakase is
meant to run in scripts, CI, and other agents' tool calls.

```bash
# Stream a run and stop when the tests pass. Exit code: 0 met, 1 not, 130 cancelled.
omks run "fix the failing tests" --check "bun test" --max-usd 2

# Machine-readable: one JSON event per line, pipe it anywhere.
omks run "add /healthz" --json | jq -r 'select(.type=="agent:completed") | .payload.text'

# Watch a run started elsewhere (another shell, the dashboard, CI).
omks logs run_ab12cd34 -f

# Pick up an interrupted run: finished agent calls replay from cache.
omks resume run_ab12cd34

# Prove a workflow's shape without spending anything.
omks workflow test ship
```

Because each agent call carries a stable id (`agt_q298tw` → `q298tw`) that
appears in the log, the JSONL stream, and the per‑run journal alike,
`omks logs <runId> | grep q298tw` pulls one agent's whole story out of an
interleaved multi‑agent run.

Other agents can drive Omakase directly: `omks mcp` speaks MCP over stdio,
exposing the workflow list and a `run_goal` tool, and honours
`notifications/cancelled` mid‑run.

## The dashboard

`omks web` serves a local control center (default port **4517**; `--port n`,
`--cwd <dir>`, and `--open` to launch a browser — build the SPA first with
`bun run build:web`, otherwise the page explains how).

It is not a read‑only viewer. You can start a goal from the browser — with the
same workflow, provider, checks, criteria and budget caps `omks run` accepts —
and cancel it mid‑flight; runs execute in the `omks web` process and stream over
SSE into the same event store. The run view groups the stream into phase
sections and collapsible per‑agent cards, each folding in its own activity,
cost and final output; the run list is searchable, session‑grouped, and
keyboard‑navigable (`j`/`k`). Dark and light both ship, and it is responsive
down to a phone.

## Concepts

### Dynamic Workflows

A workflow is a Bun/TypeScript function that receives an orchestration handle `w`:

```ts
// .omks/workflows/ship.ts
// name: ship
// description: Plan, build each step in parallel, then validate against the goal.
// version: 0.1.0
import type { WorkflowContext } from '@omakase/engine';

export default async function ship(w: WorkflowContext): Promise<void> {
  const steps = await w.phase('Plan', async () => {
    const res = await w.agent({ role: 'planner', title: 'Plan', prompt: `Break down: ${w.goal.text}` });
    return res.text.split('\n').map((l) => l.replace(/^[-*\d.\s]+/, '').trim()).filter(Boolean);
  });

  await w.phase('Build', async () => {
    await w.pipeline(
      steps,
      (_v, step) => w.agent({ role: 'worker',   title: `Build ${step}`,  prompt: `Implement: ${step}` }),
      (built, step) => w.agent({ role: 'reviewer', title: `Review ${step}`, prompt: `Review: ${step}\n${(built as any).text}` }),
    );
  });

  await w.phase('Validate', async () => {
    await w.loopUntil(async () => {
      const { met, gaps } = await w.goalMet();
      if (met) return [];
      await w.parallel(gaps.map((g) => () => w.agent({ role: 'worker', title: 'Fix', prompt: `Fix: ${g}` })));
      return gaps;
    }, { maxRounds: 3 });
  });

  w.requestReport({ kind: 'final', title: 'Done', summary: `Shipped ${steps.length} step(s).` });
}
```

The `w` API:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `w.phase(name, fn)` | group work into a named, logged phase |
| `w.agent({role,title,prompt,provider?,model?,systemPrompt?,cwd?})` | run one agent turn → `{text,status,sessionId,provider,tokens,costUsd}` |
| `w.parallel([...])` | run thunks concurrently (bounded), await all |
| `w.pipeline(items, ...stages)` | stage each item independently — no barrier |
| `w.loopUntil(fn, {maxRounds})` | loop until `fn` returns `[]` |
| `w.goalMet()` | evaluate the goal's success criteria now |
| `w.ask(question, {options?,default?})` | ask the human — journaled, and replayed on resume |
| `w.spawn(provider, prompt, title?)` | one-shot turn on a named provider |
| `w.budget()` · `w.log()` · `w.requestReport()` · `w.updateWiki()` | accounting, logging, reports, knowledge |
| `w.subdir(name)` · `w.isolate(label, fn)` | isolate parallel agents (subdir; or a git worktree that merges back) |
| `w.recall(limit)` · `w.providers` | accumulated knowledge; available agents (for routing) |
| `w.goal` · `w.params` · `w.cwd` · `w.signal` | the goal, `--param` values, working dir, cancellation |

Workflows live either as a flat `<name>.ts` or a **skills‑like folder** with `WORKFLOW.md` (frontmatter incl. a SEMVER `version`) + `workflow.ts` + optional `references/`. Workspace workflows shadow built‑ins of the same name, so you can customize anything. `omks workflow version <name> --bump minor` snapshots and bumps. See [`examples/workflows/ship-feature/`](examples/workflows/ship-feature) for a real folder‑format workflow using `isolate` + provider routing + `recall`. Validate a workflow without spending anything: `omks workflow test <name>`.

**Keeping a run.** `omks run "…" --workflow auto --save-as api-audit` writes what
just executed into `.omks/workflows/api-audit/` as real source: the phases it ran,
the agents that ran in parallel, and their prompts with the original goal swapped
for `${w.goal.text}`. This is the accumulation loop — a good one-off orchestration
becomes something you can run again, and edit. It works for any workflow, because
the engine watched the execution rather than asking a model to reconstruct it.

Built‑ins: **goal** (default), **auto** (prompt self‑orchestration — the model designs its own DAG), **mission**, **tdd**, **review**, **research**, **parallel**, **solo**.

**Isolating parallel agents.** Agents in `parallel`/`pipeline` share the run's working directory by default. When branches are independent, give each its own folder with `w.subdir(name)` + `agent({ cwd })` so they never edit the same files — the built‑in **parallel** workflow does exactly this.

**Workflows must be replayable.** `agent()` results are cached by the call's
*structural position*, which is what makes resume work across `parallel` and
`pipeline` — and what makes a workflow that branches on `Math.random()` or the
clock quietly wrong on resume: the second run takes a different branch and the
cache hands it an answer to a question it never asked. `omks workflow lint`
rejects those calls (exit 1); pass timestamps and randomness in through
`--param` instead, where they are recorded with the run. Advisories, like a
workflow that never dispatches an agent, do not fail unless you add `--strict`.

### Goal‑loop, verification, resume & retry

- **Success criteria** are `command` (exit 0), `file` (exists/matches), `rule` (regex over the tree) or `judge` (agent‑scored rubric). The loop is *done* only when all pass; it stops early on budget exhaustion, a fatal error, cancellation, or a **no‑progress stall**.
- **Resume:** each `agent()` call is keyed by a deterministic structural path and its result is journaled. `omks resume <id>` replays finished calls from cache and re‑drives the rest — robust even across `parallel`/`pipeline`.
- **Foundation retry:** provider calls retry with exponential backoff + jitter, never on cancellation; **rate‑limit / overload** errors back off much harder and record `rateLimitedUntil`.
- **Provider fallback:** if an agent's provider keeps failing, Omakase falls back to the next available provider (emitting `harness:switched`) — so a claude outage doesn't stall the run.
- **Budget:** cap a run by agent calls, **USD spend**, or **wall‑clock** (`--max-agents` / `--max-usd` / `--max-time`); the loop stops with the precise reason.

### Permission modes

What an agent may do is separate from which provider runs it:

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `read-only` | may inspect, may not modify |
| `edit` | may change the working directory without per-action approval |
| `bypass` | skips approval entirely, sandbox included (the default) |

Each adapter expresses these in its own native flags — `claude` via
`--permission-mode plan\|acceptEdits\|bypassPermissions`, `codex` via
`-s read-only\|workspace-write` or its bypass flag. **A provider that cannot
express a mode refuses the run** rather than quietly granting more: `gemini`,
`cursor-agent`, `copilot` and `qwen` expose a single all-or-nothing switch, so
they can only do `bypass`. Set it per run with `--permission`, per workspace
with `omks config set permission …`, or per agent with `w.agent({ permission })`.

This is what makes the stall advisor's read-only real: it asks for a mode the
provider must prove in its own sandbox flags, and simply does not run on a
provider that cannot promise it.

### Providers & harnesses

Detected via `<cmd> --version` over an augmented `PATH`; results cached in `.omks/agents.json`. Each adapter builds the exact headless invocation and normalizes the CLI's stream into activities + a result. Verified flags for `claude` (`-p --output-format stream-json …`), `codex` (`exec --json -C <cwd> -o <file>`), `gemini` (`-y -o stream-json`), `cursor-agent` (`-p --output-format stream-json`).

> **Auth:** detection only checks that a CLI is installed — each provider must also be **authenticated for headless use**: `claude` needs an active login (`claude` → `/login`), `gemini` needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or a configured auth method), `codex` needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `cursor-agent` needs `CURSOR_API_KEY`. If a provider isn't authed, Omakase surfaces its real error (e.g. "Not logged in") and moves on.

## Architecture

A Bun workspace of focused packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@omakase/core` | domain types, `.omks` workspace, event‑sourced SQLite store, budget, logging |
| `@omakase/providers` | detect & drive agent CLIs; spawn, stream‑parse, cancel |
| `@omakase/engine` | the `w` runtime, goal‑loop, verify, resume, retry, workflow loader, built‑ins, harness |
| `@omakase/tui` | OpenTUI + React 19 terminal interface |
| `@omakase/web` | Vite 8 + React 19 dashboard SPA, served by `omks web` |
| `@omakase/cli` | the `omks` command |

```
